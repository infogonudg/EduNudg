# Journey: Brand operator

## Student lead operations

1. **Unassigned** — brand applications awaiting center pick.
2. **Assign** — suggestions from pincode; confirm manually; may override to any center.
3. **Stale** — franchise inactive 15+ days (configurable); reallocate to another center.
4. **Lost** — view-only list with `lost_reason` (set by center). **Reopen** action for brand when business warrants.

## Franchise operations

- Approve inquiry → center host live + operator invite (same transaction).
- **Import Franchise** CSV/Excel on `/app/centers` — same template and `import_franchise_centers` RPC as platform admins ([ops](../ops/franchise-center-csv-import.md)). Reimporting the same Franchise Owner **name** overwrites that franchise and reactivates it if it was deleted. Rows with `owner_email` receive the brand-derived initial backend password (one-word lowercase brand name + `@123`), shown on completion.
- **Export Franchise** downloads every live franchise (`{brandSlug}-franchises-{date}.csv`) even when the directory is filtered.
- Selecting a franchise smoothly brings the second-column detail panel to the top while the sticky first-column directory remains in place.
- Open that franchise’s **Frontend** (public site) and **Backend** (`/app`) from the franchise detail panel (**View Frontend** / **View Backend**).
- **Disable / Enable** franchise (`suspended` ↔ `active`). **Delete franchise** opens a confirmation popup, then soft-deletes (`deleted_at`). Approved Franchise Applications stay as history on **Decided** with a DELETED badge (sorted after live decided rows).
- Read-only visibility into any student/center under brand from **Students** (`/app/students`) — contact details and current curriculum levels for growth planning. **Export CSV** in the page header downloads the full roster (`{brandSlug}-students-{date}.csv`).

## Billing

- Brand pays **EduNudg** subscription (platform admin / invoices).
- Royalties and kits are **brand ↔ franchise**, not platform.
