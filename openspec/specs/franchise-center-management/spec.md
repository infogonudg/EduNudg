- CSV bulk import: [`openspec/specs/franchise-center-csv-import/spec.md`](../franchise-center-csv-import/spec.md)
- Change source: `openspec/changes/franchise-center-management/` (shipped; mainline copy)

## Requirements

### Requirement: Master-detail franchise workspace

Brand staff SHALL view franchise centers in a two-column layout: searchable list and detail panel.

#### Scenario: Select center shows detail

- **WHEN** brand staff click a franchise in the list
- **THEN** the detail panel shows profile, KPIs, curriculum assignment, and lifecycle actions
- **AND** the viewport scrolls smoothly to the top of the second-column detail panel
- **AND** the list remains visible in the first column
- **AND** regression `regression_selecting_franchise_scrolls_only_detail_column_to_top` stays green

#### Scenario: Search by name or phone

- **WHEN** brand staff enter text in the search field
- **THEN** the list filters by center name, display name, or contact phone

### Requirement: Edit franchise profile

Brand staff SHALL edit franchise details except slug.

#### Scenario: Save profile updates

- **WHEN** brand staff save profile changes
- **THEN** `franchise_centers` fields update via authorized RPCs
- **AND** slug is not modified
- **AND** Franchise Identity labels **Franchise Owner** (`name`) and **Display Name** (`display_name`)
- **AND** Location & Contact labels **State** for `region`

#### Scenario: Save stays visible while scrolling

- **WHEN** brand staff scroll the franchise detail panel upward through a long form
- **THEN** **Save Changes** (and nearby lifecycle actions) remain in a sticky bottom action bar
- **AND** photo/size errors next to Save stay in that same sticky region
- **AND** regression `regression_franchise_save_actions_stay_sticky_while_scrolling` stays green

#### Scenario: Oversized franchise photo error near Save

- **WHEN** brand staff upload a franchise photo larger than 5 MB
- **THEN** the client rejects the upload before Storage with a clear size message
- **AND** the error appears next to **Save Changes** in a highlighted danger card (`ed-mutation-error`), not plain black text
- **AND** regressions `regression_center_photo_rejects_images_over_5mb`, `regression_franchise_photo_error_shows_near_save_via_onError`, `regression_franchise_photo_error_shows_near_save_button`, and `regression_mutation_error_uses_highlighted_danger_card` stay green

### Requirement: Franchise Management has no social media editor

Brand `/app/centers` SHALL NOT show or edit franchise social media. Profile Save SHALL pass through existing `franchise_centers.social_links` without a Social Media form. Center public footers SHALL use brand `social_connect` instead of those stored links.

#### Scenario: Detail panel omits Social Media

- **WHEN** brand staff open a franchise in the second column of `/app/centers`
- **THEN** the detail panel has no **Social Media** section, platform picker, or **+ Add Link**
- **AND** saving identity/location/curriculum does not let staff change social URLs from this page

### Requirement: Center owner login credentials

Brand staff SHALL view and set the franchise center login email and password from Franchise Identity on `/app/centers`. Credentials SHALL provision Supabase Auth and an active `center_owner` membership so the same email/password work on the center host `/login`. Login email SHALL NOT be stored on `franchise_centers`; source of truth is Auth + `profiles` + memberships. Profile-only saves SHALL NOT call `center-owner-credentials`. Franchise Identity helper text SHALL show an environment-aware login URL via `portalLoginUrl` (local `{center}.{brand}.localhost:9000/login`; same-origin `/login?portal=center&brand=…&center=…` on `*.vercel.app` and brand custom domains). **View Frontend** / **View Backend** SHALL use `centerPortalUrl` / `portalBackendUrl` the same way — never `{center}.{brand}.localhost` when the brand app is on a production custom domain without `VITE_PORTAL_BASE_DOMAIN`.

#### Scenario: Show login email from database

- **WHEN** brand staff open a franchise detail panel
- **THEN** Franchise Identity shows the active `center_owner` login email from `get_center_owner_login`
- **AND** helper text links to the center staff login URL for the current environment

#### Scenario: Create or reset franchise password

- **WHEN** brand staff enter a login email and password (password required when no prior login exists) and save
- **THEN** the SPA invokes `center-owner-credentials` to create or update the Auth user and sync `center_owner` membership
- **AND** that email and password can sign in at the center portal login URL (`portalLoginUrl`)
- **AND** passwords shorter than 6 characters (including `admin`) are rejected with a clear message — Auth does not allow them
- **AND** that error scrolls into view so staff do not have to hunt for it above Save Changes

#### Scenario: Profile-only save skips credentials

- **WHEN** brand staff save name, photo, or description without intentionally editing login fields
- **THEN** the SPA does not invoke `upsertCenterOwnerCredentials` / `center-owner-credentials`

### Requirement: Bulk CSV import

Brand staff with `centers.create` SHALL bulk-onboard franchise centers from CSV or Excel on `/app/centers`, using the same flow as platform admins (`import_franchise_centers`).

#### Scenario: Import Franchise on franchise management

- **GIVEN** brand owner or brand admin is on `/app/centers`
- **WHEN** they click **Import Franchise** (primary header action)
- **THEN** the franchise center CSV/Excel import dialog opens
- **AND** created centers appear in the directory after a successful import

See [`openspec/specs/franchise-center-csv-import/spec.md`](../franchise-center-csv-import/spec.md).

### Requirement: Export franchise spreadsheet

Brand staff SHALL download the full live franchise directory as UTF-8 CSV from `/app/centers`. Search and KPI filters SHALL NOT shrink the export. Soft-deleted centers SHALL NOT appear (they are already omitted from the directory query).

#### Scenario: Export Franchise from the page header

- **GIVEN** brand staff are on `/app/centers` with at least one franchise
- **WHEN** they click **Export Franchise** in the top-right header (secondary, beside **Import Franchise**)
- **THEN** the browser downloads an Excel workbook named `{brandSlug}-franchises-{YYYY-MM-DD}.xlsx`
- **AND** the `Franchises` sheet includes every live franchise (active and suspended), not only the filtered directory
- **AND** columns include `center_slug`, `name` (Franchise Owner), `proposed_franchise_name` (Display Name), `city`, `state`, `country`, `address`, `pincode`, `mobile_number`, `curriculum_assignment`, and `status`
- **AND** `country` defaults to `IN` when the stored value is empty
- **AND** a `Curriculum` sheet lists that brand’s course names for the `curriculum_assignment` dropdown
- **AND** the file SHALL NOT include `short_description`

### Requirement: View franchise frontend and backend

Brand staff SHALL open the selected franchise public site and staff app from `/app/centers`.

#### Scenario: View frontend and backend

- **GIVEN** brand staff have a franchise selected
- **WHEN** they click **View Frontend** or **View Backend**
- **THEN** the browser opens the center marketing URL or center `/app` in a new tab

#### Scenario: Custom brand domain avoids localhost center hosts

- **GIVEN** brand staff are on a purchased brand host without `VITE_PORTAL_BASE_DOMAIN` (e.g. `www.smartbraineducations.com/app/centers`)
- **WHEN** they click **View Frontend** or **View Backend** for a franchise
- **THEN** the new tab SHALL open same-origin URLs with `?portal=center&brand=…&center=…` (path `/` or `/app`)
- **AND** the href SHALL NOT use `{center}.{brand}.localhost`

### Requirement: Disable and enable franchise

Brand staff SHALL disable and enable franchises reversibly (`set_franchise_center_status` `suspended` ↔ `active`).

#### Scenario: Disable blocks center staff

- **WHEN** brand staff disable a franchise
- **THEN** `franchise_centers.status` becomes `suspended`
- **AND** center staff cannot access center `/app` or run center mutation RPCs
- **AND** brand staff may still manage the franchise from the brand portal

#### Scenario: Enable restores access

- **WHEN** brand staff enable a disabled franchise
- **THEN** `franchise_centers.status` becomes `active`
- **AND** center staff access is restored

### Requirement: Center staff stay on their franchise

Active center memberships SHALL NOT grant brand-wide access. `user_brand_ids()` / `has_brand_access` SHALL only reflect brand and platform scopes. Center staff SHALL access their own center (and students enrolled there) via `has_center_access` / `student_enrolled_at_accessible_center`, and MAY read brand catalog rows for that brand via `has_center_staff_for_brand` without mutating other franchises.

#### Scenario: Center membership does not elevate to brand

- **GIVEN** an active `scope_type = 'center'` membership for franchise Mumbai under brand Spark
- **WHEN** RLS helpers evaluate brand and center access
- **THEN** `has_brand_access(Spark)` is false
- **AND** `has_center_access(Mumbai)` is true
- **AND** `has_center_access(Delhi)` is false for another franchise under Spark
- **AND** regression `regression_center_staff_membership_does_not_grant_brand_access` stays green

### Requirement: Soft-delete franchise

Brand staff with `centers.delete` SHALL remove a franchise from Brand Backend via `soft_delete_franchise_center`.

#### Scenario: Confirm delete

- **WHEN** brand staff click **Delete franchise**
- **THEN** a centered confirmation dialog opens (not an inline section below the fold)
- **AND** when they confirm, `franchise_centers.deleted_at` is set and status becomes `closed`
- **AND** the center disappears from `/app/centers` and public landing
- **AND** student and lead rows are not hard-deleted
- **AND** regression `regression_brand_centers_confirm_delete_calls_soft_delete_rpc` stays green

### Requirement: Version-level curriculum assignment

Brand staff SHALL assign and unassign published curriculum versions per franchise.

#### Scenario: Sync curriculum versions

- **WHEN** brand staff save curriculum assignment for a center
- **THEN** `center_curriculum_enablement` reflects the selected published versions
- **AND** center batches may only use authorized versions

#### Scenario: Block removal of version in use

- **WHEN** brand staff remove a version that has active batches at the center
- **THEN** the sync is rejected with `CURRICULUM_VERSION_IN_USE`

#### Scenario: Franchise public site lists assigned programs only

- **WHEN** a visitor opens that franchise’s public marketing site
- **THEN** program cards come from `center_program_enablement` for that center
- **AND** Center sites accordion cards for unassigned courses are not shown

### Requirement: Student impact deferred

Student learn portal behavior when a franchise is suspended is out of scope for this change.

#### Scenario: Documented TODO

- **WHEN** this capability ships
- **THEN** student portal suspend behavior remains unchanged until a follow-up change
