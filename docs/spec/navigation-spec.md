# Navigation spec — left sidebar (`/admin`, `/app`)

Target state for v1 implementation. Source of truth for menu labels; routes must exist in `AppRoutes.tsx` when marked **new**.

**Confirmed (product):**

- Brand: separate **Student Leads** and **Franchise Applications**
- Platform: self-serve approvals on **`/admin/brands`** (manual add + pending queue + brand list)
- Student (`learn.*`): **Dashboard** + **Profile** only in v1

---

## Center (franchise) — `/app`

On desktop and mobile, the staff chrome lockup shows the **franchise display name** next to the Site logo, with a smaller **by {brand}** line under it when the names differ. Login uses the same lockup.

| Section | Item | Route | Status |
|---------|------|-------|--------|

**Center `/app/settings`:** franchise staff edit display name, description, address, photo, and phone. Login email is read-only from auth; public marketing URL is the center website. Footer social icons use brand Social Media Connect.

**Center `/app/leads`:** assigned leads + direct `lead_source = center`; status changes reset SLA; **Convert** action. Page chrome matches center Curriculum (`PipelinePageHeader`, `LeadKpiGrid`, search + `FilterTabs`, `PipelineWorkspace`). Center `/app/students`, `/app/fees`, `/app/inventory`, and `/app/merchandise` use the same stats + list/detail chrome.

---

## Student — `learn.*` host

Authenticated student chrome uses the same franchise lockup as center staff (franchise name, then “by {brand}”) from the student’s center, with the brand Site logo.

| Section | Item | Route | Status |
|---------|------|-------|--------|
| Main | Dashboard | `/` | Exists |
| Main | Progress | `/progress` | Exists |
| Main | Competitions | `/competitions` | Exists — labeled Events; gated by brand `competitions` flag |
| Main | Activity | `/activity` | Exists |
| General | Profile | `/profile` | Exists |
| — | Kits / merchandise | — | **Not in nav** (FR-S03) |

No sidebar required on mobile — single column shell acceptable.

---

## Parents — `parents.*` host

Out of v1 scope. Spec placeholder: mirror student minimal nav when built.

---

## Public marketing nav (top bar, not sidebar)

| Host | CTA anchors |
|------|-------------|
| Platform | Sign in → `/login`; brand signup section on `/` |
| Brand | `#apply` franchise, `#enroll-student` student application; `/login` uses brand public nav/footer |
| Center | `#register` student registration; **Student Login** → `learn.{brand}/login?center={center}` |
| Learn | `/login` uses that franchise public nav/footer when the center is known |

Indexable public **routes** (not hashes): platform `/` + `/legal/:kind`; brand `/`, `/about`, `/courses/:slug`, `/legal/:kind`; center `/`, `/courses/:slug`, `/legal/:kind`. See [`public-seo`](../../openspec/specs/public-seo/spec.md).

---

## Implementation notes

- Update [`apps/web/src/lib/portalNav.tsx`](../../apps/web/src/lib/portalNav.tsx) when routes are added.
- Home active state: exact match for `/admin` and `/app` (regression tests required).
- App pages use `PageGrid`, `PageGridFull`, `FormGrid` from `@edunudg/ui` — see [ui-shell-standards.md](./ui-shell-standards.md).
- Manual lead entry: [manual-leads.md](./manual-leads.md).
